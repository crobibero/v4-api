# TVDB V4 API
We have two models for API access, both that provide funding that allows us to continue running and improving the site. The first is our negotiated license model, which allows commercial companies to negotiate access with us. The second is a user-subscription model, which allows end users to access the API if they are subscribed. We reserve the right to change our interfaces, fees, or licensing terms at any point without notice.

To create an API key, create an account and visit the [API keys page on your dashboard](https://www.thetvdb.com/dashboard/account/apikey).
